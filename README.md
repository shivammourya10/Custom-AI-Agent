# Custom AI Agent 🤖

A intelligent conversational AI agent that can perform multiple tasks through natural language commands. This project demonstrates how AI agents work in real-world applications by combining language understanding with tool execution capabilities.

## What is Custom AI Agent?

The Custom AI Agent is a conversational AI system that can:
- **Understand natural language** queries from users
- **Execute specific functions** based on user requests
- **Provide real-time information** from multiple data sources
- **Maintain conversation context** throughout the session
- **Handle multiple tool calls** intelligently

Unlike simple chatbots, this AI agent can actually perform actions and fetch live data, making it a practical tool for everyday tasks.

## How AI Agents Work in Real Life

This project is a simplified demonstration of how AI agents operate in production environments:

### Traditional Approach vs AI Agent Approach

**Traditional Way:**
```
User needs crypto price → Opens CoinGecko → Searches Bitcoin → Gets price
User needs weather → Opens weather app → Searches city → Gets temperature
User needs calculation → Opens calculator → Performs math → Gets result
```

**AI Agent Way:**
```
User: "What's the price of Bitcoin and temperature in Delhi?"
Agent: Automatically fetches both pieces of information and responds in natural language
```

### Real-World AI Agent Applications
- **Customer Support**: Agents that can check orders, update accounts, and resolve issues
- **Personal Assistants**: Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant
- **Business Automation**: Agents that can book meetings, send emails, generate reports
- **E-commerce**: Shopping assistants that can search products, compare prices, place orders
